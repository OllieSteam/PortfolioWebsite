                    <h3>Career.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Throughout my career, I have gained a wide range of experience in defence and military contracting. I have worked on multiple projects for various clients, including major defence contractors and government agencies. My experience includes the development of command and control systems, intelligence analysis tools, and simulation software.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        In another experience, I worked on a project for a government agency where I was responsible for developing a simulation software used to train military personnel. This project required me to have a deep understanding of the client's requirements and constraints, as well as the ability to work with sensitive and classified information. The simulation software was successful and is still being used for training purpose.
